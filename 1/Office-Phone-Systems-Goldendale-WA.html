<p>VoIP phone service has actually been around for some time as businesses and business owners change from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to an advanced system. There is a substantial range of VoIP providers on the internet which provide SIP trunking (telephony services) for less expensive call rates than conventional telephony providers.
